Here's a breakdown of functionalities you can provide to Users and Library Admins in your library management system:

**User Functionalities:**

* **Search for Books:** Users should be able to search for books by title, author, ISBN, or other relevant criteria.
* **View Book Details:** Users should be able to see details of a book, including title, author, ISBN, publication year, a short description (optional), and availability status (available or issued).
* **Request to Issue a Book:** Users should be able to request to issue a book, if it's available. This might involve adding the book to a cart or wishlist for checkout.
* **View Loan History:** Users should be able to see their loan history, including a list of books they have borrowed, issue dates, due dates, and return dates (if applicable).
* **Renew a Loan (Optional):** Depending on library policies, users might be able to renew loans online if the book is not requested by another user.
* **Update User Information (Optional):** Users might be able to update their profile information like name, email address, or password.

**Library Admin Functionalities:**

* **Manage Users:** Admins can create, edit, and delete user accounts. They might also be able to assign user roles (e.g., librarian, patron) with different access levels.
* **Manage Books:** Admins can add new books to the library system, edit existing book details, and mark books as issued or returned. They might also be able to manage book categories, authors, and publishers.
* **View Loan Requests:** Admins can see requests from users to issue books and approve or reject them based on availability and library policies.
* **Manage Loan Periods and Fines (Optional):** Admins might be able to configure loan periods, set overdue fines, and manage user accounts with outstanding fines.
* **Generate Reports:** Admins can generate reports on various aspects of the library, such as book usage, overdue loans, and user activity.
* **System Configuration:** Admins might be able to configure system settings such as email notifications, user roles and permissions, and library policies.

**Additional Considerations:**

* You can prioritize functionalities based on your library's specific needs and user base.
* Consider implementing a user interface (web or mobile app) that provides a user-friendly way to access these functionalities.
* Security is crucial. Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms to control access to sensitive information and functionalities.

By providing these functionalities, you can create a user-friendly and efficient library management system that caters to both users and library admins.
